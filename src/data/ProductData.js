        description: "Noise reduction from outside – ANC and ENC technology\n\nThanks to the use of ANC technology, headphones with a high-performance dual-core DSP processing chip capture environmental noise in various frequency bands. This is done using a highly noise-sensitive microphone. It reduces noise by up to 45dB. ENC microphone technology was also used. Four ENC microphones filter the outside sound with artificial intelligence, so you will be heard clearly while talking.\n\nThe working range of the headphones is really large and amounts to 10 meters. At this distance, the transmission can be up to twice as fast as in other devices, which guarantees the transmission of clear sounds without interference and delays. They go straight to the ear, which is ensured by an ergonomically built speaker, filled with a soft sponge with a frame imitating leather. It adheres perfectly to the body, so you won’t miss a single note. They have the option of size adjustment, so they fit men and women with different head circumferences.\n\nThe headphones can work for up to 70 hours on a charged battery, which means that they will accompany you on a journey and anywhere else. The polymer battery has a capacity of 800mAh, which in standby mode allows the headphones to work even for a month.\nIn handling, design and operation – Baseus headphones are minimalistic and simple. Ergonomic, smooth shape gives them character and makes them suitable for every situation, electronic equipment and user style. You can adjust the volume with just one hand, and you will start or stop the headphones in the same way. The buttons are really small and almost invisible, but well felt on the casing.",
